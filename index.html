        <h2>What you will see in Alsaka?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="first">The highest peak of North America - Denali</li>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Every_Road-_Denali_%287945497984%29.jpg/450px-Every_Road-_Denali_%287945497984%29.jpg" width="900">
            <p>The highest mountain peak in North America, with a summit elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190 m) above sea level. With a topographic prominence of 20,194 feet (6,155 m) and a topographic isolation of 4,621.1 miles (7,436.9 km), Denali is the third most prominent and third most isolated peak on Earth, after Mount Everest and Aconcagua. Located in the Alaska Range in the interior of the U.S. state of Alaska, Denali is the centerpiece of Denali National Park and Preserve.</p>
            <li class="second">Glaciers & <strong id="blue">blue</strong> ice</li>

            <p>The Ice Age hasn’t ended in Alaska! Gobs of hanging glaciers can be seen from just about every highway that traverses Alaska’s high mountains. Many terrestrial glaciers can be approached up close by people who can handle short hikes. Go to sea on a day cruise or fishing charter, and you’ll discover the coastal mountains of Southcentral and Southeast Alaska are among the best places in the world to experience glacier calving. And don’t forget the uncounted thousands in remote areas—many accessible by air charters or mountaineering trips. You’ll never run out of glacial viewing options.</p>
            <li class="third">Wildlife, terrestrial or aquatic!</li>

            <p>Alaska is where the wild things are, and the state’s incredible wildlife is as diverse as its landscapes. People travel from around the world to view Alaska’s Big 5: bear, moose, Dall sheep, wolf, and caribou, along with impressive marine mammals like humpback whales, orcas, and gray whales.</p>

        <h2>What you can do in Alaska?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="first">Kayaking</li>
            <img src="web_images/IMG_20190607.jpg" width="900">
            <p>Alaska has a long and rich history of kayaking; qayats, made of animal skins sketched over wooden frames, have been used here by the Indigenous people to hunt marine animals for thousands of years.<br>It also has plenty of coastline to explore—54,563 km of it, to be precise. But if you’re trying to figure out exactly where to go kayaking in Alaska, it’s best to narrow your search to the southernmost part of the state in the Gulf of Alaska.</p>
            <li class="second">Glacier Hiking</li>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/FGG_Fox-glacier-heli-hike-group-helicopter_01.jpg/330px-FGG_Fox-glacier-heli-hike-group-helicopter_01.jpg" width="900">
            <p>Alaska has many accessible glaciers across the state that allow visitors to experience a frozen wonderland even in the height of summer. Guided glacier tours allow you to have safe, firsthand encounters with Alaska’s magnificent glaciers. Alaska’s glacier hiking and climbing trips are designed for a variety of interest and experience levels.</p>
            <li class="third">Flightseeing</li>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Helic%C3%B3ptero_Robinson_R44%2C_Portage%2C_Alaska%2C_Estados_Unidos%2C_2017-08-22%2C_DD_42.jpg/900px-Helic%C3%B3ptero_Robinson_R44%2C_Portage%2C_Alaska%2C_Estados_Unidos%2C_2017-08-22%2C_DD_42.jpg" width="900">
            <p>Experience the natural history below you as you watch rivers run from valleys filled with melting glaciers, and fly over young birch and aspen forests which fade into ancient spruce bogs or endless rolling tundra. Beauty takes on a new scale in the air, as you travel not just to get from here to there, but to see every living thing in between. Civilization fades into distant memory as you float over jagged peaks that have never felt the press of a human footprint or spot a bear foraging in the wild.<br>
Some small planes are equipped with floats to land on mountain lakes, remote rivers, or ocean bays. Others deploy skis to land on snowy glaciers. Most flights offer all window seats, pilot narration, and individual headsets. Operators offer set prices for seats on flightseeing trips to popular destinations. You can also charter by the hour for trips to remote wilderness destinations.</p>
